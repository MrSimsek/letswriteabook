    <h1>Hello! I am Deniz Simsek from <br />Istanbul, Turkey.</h1>
    <p>
      I wondered how would it be if different people -different minds- around the globe come together and create something new. Not some product that can be consumed but something that will directly represent each cultural, geographical mindset and different kinds of imagination. Maybe it won't bring much value into any economy, maybe it won't be the unification like I think it will be but the idea of creating something which putted together piece by piece with different minds of our world is very exciting to me. So for the first experiment, I would like to invite you to bring your imagination into <b>a whole new book</b> that will be written by people like you from anywhere in the world, <b>piece by piece</b>.

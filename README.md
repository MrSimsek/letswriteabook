# Let's Write A Book
This will be a complete physical book written by random people from all around the globe.

A sheet of paper will start the journey. Each pile of paper filled with indiviudal additons to the srtory by writers from all around globe, will stack upon that first sheet of paper.

## How it will work?
Think about a manufacturing line. In every step final product is being completed step by step through different workstations. Now change product with a book, change the workers with writers, and most importantly change the workstations with countries.
Every 2 or 3 pages of our book will be written in different countries, with different minds and imaginations.
